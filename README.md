# parks_funding

CSV data that was originally formatted as a table on [New York City Council website](https://council.nyc.gov/public-advocate/park-funding/) that I used for [my project](https://juliekerisel.wixsite.com/jkrsl/parks) on NYC parks' funding.

Jupyter notebook with data exploration and a few plots of the funding data.
